# Part III: Execution

This section covers the core execution activities of Organizational Change Management—the hands-on work of communicating, training, engaging sponsors, and managing resistance throughout the change lifecycle.

## Overview

With assessments complete and plans in place, OCM practitioners move into active execution. This section provides detailed guidance on:

- **Chapter 8: Communication Planning and Execution** - Designing and delivering effective change communication
- **Chapter 9: Training and Capability Building** - Developing skills and knowledge needed for change adoption
- **Chapter 10: Sponsorship and Leadership Engagement** - Activating and sustaining executive and management sponsorship
- **Chapter 11: Resistance Management** - Identifying, understanding, and addressing resistance to change

## The Execution Challenge

Execution is where OCM plans meet organizational reality. Even the best plans will encounter:

- Competing priorities that divert attention from change activities
- Stakeholders who understand but still resist
- Sponsors who commit but don't follow through
- Training that doesn't translate to on-the-job performance
- Communication that gets lost in organizational noise

## Keys to Successful Execution

The chapters in this section emphasize:

1. **Consistency** - Sustained effort throughout the change lifecycle
2. **Adaptation** - Adjusting tactics based on feedback and results
3. **Integration** - Coordinating OCM activities with project milestones
4. **Measurement** - Tracking progress and effectiveness continuously

## Prerequisites

Before executing OCM activities, ensure you have completed:

- Stakeholder analysis and engagement planning (Chapter 5)
- Change impact assessment (Chapter 6)
- OCM strategy and planning (Chapter 7)
