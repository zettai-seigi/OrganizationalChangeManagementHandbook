# Chapter 7: OCM Strategy and Planning

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Develop comprehensive OCM strategies aligned with project objectives
- Create integrated OCM plans that coordinate all change activities
- Align OCM activities with project timelines and milestones
- Define resource requirements and governance structures
- Establish success metrics and measurement approaches

---

## The Role of OCM Strategy

OCM strategy defines the overall approach to managing the people side of change. It translates assessment findings into a coherent plan of action that guides all OCM activities throughout the change lifecycle.

Without a clear strategy, OCM activities become reactive and fragmented. Communication happens in response to problems rather than proactively building awareness. Training is designed without understanding the full scope of skill gaps. Resistance is addressed only after it emerges rather than anticipated and prevented. Resources are allocated ad hoc rather than planned for peak demand periods.

A well-developed OCM strategy provides several critical benefits:

**Alignment**: Ensures OCM activities support project objectives and business outcomes

**Coordination**: Integrates multiple OCM workstreams (communication, training, engagement) into a cohesive approach

**Resource Optimization**: Enables proactive resource planning and allocation

**Risk Management**: Identifies and addresses people-related risks before they materialize

**Accountability**: Establishes clear ownership and expectations for OCM outcomes

**Measurement**: Defines how success will be measured and tracked

---

## Strategy Development Process

### Step 1: Synthesize Assessment Findings

OCM strategy must be grounded in assessment findings. Before developing strategy, consolidate insights from:

- **Readiness Assessment**: Organizational capacity, leadership support, manager capability, individual preparedness
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Key stakeholders, their concerns, engagement requirements
- **Impact Assessment**: Scope of change, severity of impacts, mitigation needs

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- What are the critical readiness gaps that must be addressed?
- Which stakeholder groups require the most intensive engagement?
- What are the highest-severity impacts requiring robust support?
- What are the major risks to successful adoption?

### Step 2: Define OCM Objectives

Clearly articulate what OCM must accomplish. Objectives should be:

**Specific**: Clear about what will be achieved
**Measurable**: Quantifiable indicators of success
**Aligned**: Connected to project and business objectives
**Realistic**: Achievable given resources and constraints
**Time-bound**: Associated with target dates

**Example OCM Objectives:**
- Achieve 90% awareness of change rationale among all impacted employees by Week 8
- Build manager capability to support teams, with 100% of managers completing preparation by Week 10
- Achieve 85% user proficiency within 30 days of go-live
- Maintain resistance below 15% throughout implementation
- Sustain 90%+ adoption at 6 months post-implementation

### Step 3: Determine OCM Approach

Based on assessment findings and objectives, determine the overall OCM approach:

**Approach Intensity**

| Factor | Light OCM | Standard OCM | Intensive OCM |
|--------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Impact severity | Low | Medium | High |
| Stakeholder complexity | Simple | Moderate | Complex |
| Change history | Positive | Mixed | Negative |
| Organizational readiness | High | Medium | Low |
| Timeline pressure | Relaxed | Normal | Compressed |

**Methodology Selection**

Select or adapt a methodology that fits the change:
- **ADKAR-based**: Individual change focus, good for technology implementations
- **Kotter-based**: Organizational change focus, good for transformations
- **Hybrid**: Combine elements based on specific needs

### Step 4: Design OCM Workstreams

Structure OCM activities into coordinated workstreams:

**Communication Workstream**
- Key messages and message platform
- Communication channels and cadence
- Feedback mechanisms
- Metrics and measurement

**Training Workstream**
- Learning strategy and approach
- Curriculum design
- Delivery logistics
- Proficiency assessment

**Sponsorship Workstream**
- Sponsor engagement plan
- Sponsor activities and commitments
- Coalition building
- Sponsor effectiveness measurement

**Change Network Workstream**
- Change agent selection and onboarding
- Change agent activities and support
- Network coordination
- Network effectiveness measurement

**Resistance Management Workstream**
- Resistance anticipation and monitoring
- Intervention strategies
- Escalation processes
- Resolution tracking

### Step 5: Integrate with Project Plan

OCM activities must align with project milestones. Map OCM activities to the project timeline:

| Project Phase | Project Activities | OCM Activities |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Initiation | Charter, stakeholder ID | OCM assessment, strategy development |
| Planning | Requirements, design | Impact assessment, detailed OCM planning |
| Build | Development, configuration | Training development, communication preparation |
| Test | UAT, integration testing | Pilot training, readiness verification |
| Deploy | Go-live, cutover | Intensive communication, training delivery, support |
| Stabilize | Hypercare, optimization | Reinforcement, adoption monitoring, sustainment |

## Summary

OCM strategy and planning transforms the insights from assessment into actionable plans that guide change activities throughout the project lifecycle. A well-developed strategy ensures that OCM activities are proactive rather than reactive, coordinated rather than fragmented, and aligned with project objectives rather than operating in isolation.

The strategy provides the foundation; the detailed plans operationalize it. Communication plans, training plans, sponsorship plans, and resistance management plans each address a critical dimension of change adoption. Together, they create a comprehensive approach to helping people successfully transition to new ways of working.

Investment in thorough strategy and planning pays dividends through more effective execution, better resource utilization, and ultimately higher adoption rates and sustained benefits realization.
