## The Need for OCM Governance

OCM governance provides the structures, processes, and authority necessary to ensure that organizational change management is practiced consistently and effectively across the enterprise. Without governance, OCM quality varies by project and practitioner, best practices are not shared, and organizational learning does not occur.

Governance serves multiple purposes:

**Consistency**: Ensures OCM is applied using common approaches and standards

**Quality**: Maintains OCM quality through reviews and oversight

**Accountability**: Establishes clear ownership for OCM outcomes

**Integration**: Connects OCM with project, IT, and enterprise governance

**Continuous Improvement**: Enables learning and practice advancement

## Governance Structure

### OCM Governance Bodies

Depending on organizational size and OCM maturity, governance may include:

**OCM Steering Committee**
- Strategic direction for OCM practice
- Resource allocation decisions
- Policy approval
- Cross-initiative prioritization

**OCM Center of Excellence (CoE)**
- Methodology ownership and development
- Practitioner support and consultation
- Training and capability building
- Best practice identification and sharing

**OCM Community of Practice (CoP)**
- Peer learning and knowledge sharing
- Tool and template development
- Problem-solving collaboration
- Practice improvement suggestions

**Project-Level OCM Governance**
- Individual project OCM oversight
- Sponsor engagement management
- Adoption readiness decisions
- Issue escalation and resolution

### Governance Integration

OCM governance should integrate with existing governance structures:

```
Enterprise Governance
        │
        ├── IT Governance
        │       │
        │       └── Project Governance
        │               │
        │               └── OCM Governance (Project Level)
        │
        └── OCM Governance (Enterprise Level)
                │
                ├── OCM Steering Committee
                │
                ├── OCM Center of Excellence
                │
                └── OCM Community of Practice
