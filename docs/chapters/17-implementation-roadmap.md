# Chapter 17: Implementation Roadmap

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Develop a phased approach to implementing OCM capability
- Identify quick wins that demonstrate early value
- Build organizational support for OCM investment
- Create sustainable OCM capability over time
- Measure and demonstrate OCM value

---

## Implementing OCM Capability

Implementing OCM capability is itself a change initiative that requires change management. Organizations cannot simply declare that OCM will be practiced—they must build the methodology, skills, tools, and culture that enable effective OCM over time.

This chapter provides a practical roadmap for organizations at any starting point. Whether you're establishing OCM from scratch, formalizing informal practices, or advancing mature capability, the roadmap provides guidance for systematic improvement.

### Implementation Approaches

Organizations typically follow one of three approaches:

**Big Bang**: Implement comprehensive OCM capability across the organization simultaneously. Best for organizations with strong executive support, available resources, and urgent need.

**Phased Rollout**: Build OCM capability incrementally, starting with selected areas and expanding over time. Appropriate for most organizations; balances ambition with practicality.

**Pilot-Based**: Prove OCM value on selected projects before broader implementation. Best for organizations where OCM value must be demonstrated to gain support.

- Develop manager OCM orientation
- Create sponsor development program
- Build OCM community of practice

**Integrate with Project Management**
- Embed OCM activities in project methodology
- Integrate OCM deliverables with project artifacts
- Align OCM and project governance
- Train project managers on OCM integration

### Success Indicators
- OCM applied consistently to qualifying projects
- Standards and governance operational
- Growing cadre of capable OCM practitioners
- OCM integrated into project practices
- Measurable improvement in change outcomes

## Phase 4: Optimization (Months 18+)

### Objectives
- Optimize OCM practices based on data
- Build change-ready culture
- Achieve sustainable OCM capability
- Continuously improve practices

### Key Activities

**Data-Driven Improvement**

- Regularly assess OCM maturity
- Update practices based on learning
- Innovate approaches for emerging needs
- Contribute to OCM body of knowledge

### Success Indicators
- Consistent achievement of adoption targets
- Change-ready culture measurable in surveys
- Sustainable OCM function and capability
- Continuous improvement demonstrated
- Recognition as change management leader

## Building Support

### Making the Business Case

Build a compelling business case for OCM investment:

**Cost of Change Failure**
- Calculate cost of failed or struggling changes
- Include direct costs (rework, extended timelines)
- Include indirect costs (productivity loss, turnover)
- Quantify risk of continued failures

**Benefits of Effective OCM**
- Research shows OCM increases success probability by 3-6x
- Faster time to value through quicker adoption
- Reduced resistance and smoother implementation
- Higher sustained adoption and benefits realization

**Investment Required**
- OCM resources (people, tools, training)
- Phased investment aligned with capability building
- Comparison to overall project investment (typically 2-5%)

### Demonstrating Value

Continuously demonstrate OCM value:

**Leading Indicators**
- Awareness and engagement levels
- Training completion and proficiency
- Stakeholder satisfaction with OCM support

**Lagging Indicators**
- Adoption rates compared to targets
- Time to proficiency
- Resistance levels
- Benefits realization

**Comparative Analysis**
- Compare outcomes on projects with/without OCM
- Track improvement over time as capability matures
- Benchmark against industry standards

## Key Success Factors

### Executive Sponsorship
Strong, sustained executive support is essential. Sponsors must champion OCM, allocate resources, and hold leaders accountable.

### Quick Wins
Early demonstrations of value build momentum and support. Select pilots with high visibility and probability of success.

### Practitioner Development
Build capable practitioners who can deliver quality OCM. Invest in training, coaching, and experience-building.

### Integration
Embed OCM into existing practices rather than creating parallel processes. Integration increases adoption and sustainability.

### Measurement
Track and report on OCM effectiveness. Data enables improvement and demonstrates value.

### Patience
Building OCM capability takes time. Expect 2-3 years for significant maturity advancement. Maintain commitment through the journey.

## Key Takeaways

- **Implementing OCM is itself a change** that requires careful planning and change management
- **Phased implementation** builds capability incrementally while demonstrating value
- **Pilots prove value** before broader investment and build organizational support
- **Quick wins build momentum** and executive confidence in the approach
- **Sustainability requires** ongoing investment in people, processes, and culture
- **Measurement demonstrates value** and enables continuous improvement

---

## Summary

Implementing OCM capability is a journey that requires sustained commitment over multiple years. The phased roadmap provides a practical approach that builds capability incrementally while demonstrating value at each stage.

Success depends on strong executive sponsorship, capable practitioners, integration with existing practices, and continuous measurement and improvement. Organizations that commit to this journey achieve significantly better change outcomes and build a competitive advantage in their ability to adapt and evolve.

The investment in OCM capability pays dividends on every future change initiative. Organizations with mature OCM capability implement changes faster, with less resistance, and with higher sustained adoption—delivering the benefits that motivated the change in the first place.
