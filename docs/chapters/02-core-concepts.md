## Key Definitions and Terminology

### Organizational Change

An **Organizational Change** is any transformation that significantly affects how people work, the skills they need, organizational structures, business processes, or organizational culture.

**Characteristics of Organizational Change**:
- Impacts people, processes, and/or culture

## The ADKAR Model

The **ADKAR Model** (Prosci) is the foundational framework for understanding individual change. Each letter represents a building block that must be achieved in sequence:

### A - Awareness

**Definition**: Understanding why change is needed and the risk of not changing.

**Key Questions**:
- Why is this change happening?
- What is wrong with the current state?
- What are the consequences of not changing?

**OCM Activities**:
- Executive communications
- Business case presentations
- FAQ documents
- Town halls and information sessions

### D - Desire

**Definition**: Personal motivation and choice to support and participate in the change.

**Key Questions**:
- What's in it for me (WIIFM)?
- How does this align with my goals?
- Do I trust leadership's intentions?

**OCM Activities**:
- Stakeholder engagement
- Addressing personal concerns
- Sponsor visibility
- Change agent conversations

### K - Knowledge

**Definition**: Understanding how to change, including new skills, processes, and behaviors required.

**Key Questions**:
- What do I need to learn?
- How will I perform my job differently?
- Where do I get help?

**OCM Activities**:
- Training programs
- Job aids and documentation
- Demonstrations and pilots
- Knowledge base content

### A - Ability

**Definition**: Demonstrated capability to implement required skills and behaviors.

**Key Questions**:
- Can I actually do this?
- Do I have the time and resources?
- Is the environment supportive?

**OCM Activities**:
- Hands-on practice
- Coaching and mentoring
- Performance support
- Removing barriers

### R - Reinforcement

**Definition**: Actions that sustain the change and prevent regression to old behaviors.

**Key Questions**:
- Is this still the expected way of working?
- Am I recognized for adopting the change?
- What happens if I revert to old ways?

**OCM Activities**:
- Recognition programs
- Metrics and accountability
- Celebrating successes
- Corrective actions

## Stakeholder Categories

A **Stakeholder** is any individual or group that is affected by, can influence, or has an interest in a change initiative.

### Primary Stakeholders
Directly impacted by the change on a daily basis.

**Examples**: End users, process owners, team members
**Focus**: Training, support, adoption

### Secondary Stakeholders
Indirectly affected or have influence on success.

**Examples**: Managers, support staff, IT teams
**Focus**: Engagement, communication, enablement

### Key Stakeholders
Critical decision-makers and influencers.

**Examples**: Executives, sponsors, steering committee
**Focus**: Alignment, sponsorship, resource commitment

### Affected Stakeholders
Experience operational impact from the change.

**Examples**: Customers, partners, vendors
**Focus**: Communication, expectation management

### Stakeholder Analysis Matrix

| Stakeholder Group | Impact Level | Influence Level | Engagement Approach |
|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Executive Sponsors | Medium | Very High | Active sponsorship |
| Middle Managers | High | High | Change agents |
| End Users | Very High | Medium | Training & support |
| IT Support | High | Medium | Technical enablement |
| Customers | Medium | Low | Communication |

## Change Readiness

**Change Readiness** is the organizational and individual capacity and willingness to adopt a change.

### Readiness Dimensions

#### Organizational Readiness
- Culture and values alignment
- Historical change success
- Available resources and capacity
- Organizational stability

#### Leadership Readiness
- Sponsorship commitment
- Active and visible support
- Coalition building
- Resource allocation

#### Manager Readiness
- Understanding of change
- Skills to lead teams through change

- Capacity to change

### Readiness Assessment Questions

| Dimension | Assessment Questions |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Awareness** | Do people know change is coming? Do they understand why? |
| **Desire** | Are people motivated to change? Is resistance high? |
| **Knowledge** | Do people know what to do differently? |
| **Ability** | Can people perform new behaviors? Are barriers removed? |
| **Reinforcement** | Are systems aligned? Is adoption recognized? |

## Change Resistance

**Change Resistance** is opposition, pushback, or hesitation to adopt new ways of working. Resistance is natural and should be expected.

### Types of Resistance

| Type | Characteristics | Examples |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Active** | Visible, vocal opposition | Complaints, arguments, refusal |
| **Passive** | Subtle, non-confrontational | Ignoring, workarounds, minimal compliance |
| **Covert** | Hidden, undermining | Negative influence, sabotage |

### Common Sources of Resistance

1. **Fear of the Unknown**
   - Uncertainty about future state
   - Concern about ability to succeed
   - Worry about job security

2. **Loss of Control**
   - Reduced autonomy or authority
   - Changed reporting relationships
   - Different processes imposed

3. **Past Experiences**
   - Previous failed changes
   - Broken promises
   - Change fatigue

4. **Lack of Trust**
   - Skepticism about leadership intentions
   - Poor communication history
   - Perceived hidden agendas

5. **Competence Concerns**
   - Fear of appearing incompetent
   - Steep learning curve
   - Inadequate training time

6. **Change Saturation**
   - Too many concurrent changes
   - Insufficient time to adapt
   - Competing priorities

### Resistance as Feedback

**Important**: Resistance is not inherently negative. It often provides valuable information:
- Identifies gaps in communication
- Highlights legitimate concerns
- Reveals implementation barriers
- Indicates where additional support is needed

## Change Agents and Champions

### Change Agent
A **Change Agent** is an individual who actively supports and enables change by helping others transition.

**Roles**:
- Communicate change messages
- Provide peer support
- Gather feedback
- Identify and escalate issues
- Model new behaviors

### Change Champion
A **Change Champion** is a senior advocate who actively promotes and sponsors the change.

**Roles**:
- Visible support and advocacy
- Resource allocation
- Barrier removal
- Recognition and reinforcement
- Executive communication

### Change Agent Network Structure

## Key Takeaways

- **ADKAR provides a framework** for understanding individual change: Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement
- **Stakeholders must be categorized** by impact and influence to determine engagement approaches
- **Change readiness exists at multiple levels**: organizational, leadership, manager, and individual
- **Resistance is natural** and provides valuable feedback when properly managed
- **Change agents and champions** are critical for cascading change throughout the organization

---

## Summary

Understanding core OCM concepts is essential for effective change management. The ADKAR model provides a framework for diagnosing where individuals are stuck and what interventions are needed. Stakeholder analysis ensures the right engagement approaches for different groups. Change readiness assessment identifies gaps that must be addressed before and during implementation. Finally, understanding resistance as natural and informative enables proactive management rather than reactive firefighting.
