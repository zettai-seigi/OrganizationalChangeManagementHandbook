# Chapter 14: Maturity Model and Assessment

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the five levels of OCM maturity
- Assess your organization's current OCM maturity level
- Identify improvement opportunities at each maturity level
- Develop a roadmap for advancing OCM maturity
- Apply maturity model insights to improve change outcomes

## The Value of Maturity Assessment

OCM maturity assessment helps organizations understand their current capability for managing the people side of change and provides a roadmap for improvement. Organizations with higher OCM maturity consistently achieve better change outcomes—faster adoption, less resistance, higher sustainment, and better benefits realization.

Maturity assessment serves several purposes:

**Benchmark Current State**: Understand where you are today

**Identify Gaps**: Recognize specific areas needing improvement

**Prioritize Investments**: Focus limited resources on highest-impact improvements

**Track Progress**: Measure advancement over time

**Set Expectations**: Calibrate expectations based on current capability

## The Five Maturity Levels

### Level 1: Ad-Hoc

At the Ad-Hoc level, change management is not a recognized discipline. Changes are implemented without deliberate attention to the people side, and outcomes depend entirely on individual leader capability and luck.

**Characteristics**:
- No formal OCM process or methodology
- Change activities happen inconsistently, if at all
- No dedicated OCM resources or roles
- Success depends on individual heroics
- Little awareness that OCM is a discipline

**Typical Outcomes**:
- Highly variable change success
- Frequent resistance and adoption failures
- No learning across changes
- Repeated mistakes

**Indicators**:
- "We just announce changes and expect people to adapt"
- "Change management? That's just common sense"
- "Our last three system implementations failed to achieve adoption"

### Level 2: Emerging

At the Emerging level, the organization recognizes that OCM matters and applies it to some changes, typically large or high-visibility projects. Approach is inconsistent and dependent on individual practitioners.

**Characteristics**:
- OCM applied to select projects
- Basic activities (communication, training) performed
- No standard methodology or templates
- OCM resources borrowed from other roles
- Some leaders champion OCM; others don't

**Typical Outcomes**:
- Better outcomes on projects with OCM
- Significant variation in OCM quality
- Some learning, poorly shared
- Growing recognition of OCM value

**Indicators**:
- "We do change management on big projects"
- "It depends on whether the project manager believes in it"
- "Our OCM approach varies significantly across projects"

### Level 3: Defined

At the Defined level, the organization has standardized OCM methodology, tools, and expectations. OCM is applied consistently to changes meeting defined criteria, with dedicated resources and defined roles.

**Characteristics**:
- Standard OCM methodology defined
- Templates, tools, and playbooks available
- OCM roles defined (even if not full-time)
- Consistent application based on criteria
- Training available for OCM practitioners

**Typical Outcomes**:
- Consistent OCM application
- More predictable change outcomes
- Learning captured and shared
- Growing organizational capability

**Indicators**:
- "We have an OCM methodology that projects follow"
- "Our OCM templates help ensure nothing is missed"
- "Projects are required to have an OCM plan"

### Level 4: Managed

At the Managed level, OCM effectiveness is measured and managed. Data drives continuous improvement of OCM practices. OCM is integrated into project governance and portfolio management.

**Characteristics**:
- Metrics track OCM effectiveness
- Data-driven continuous improvement
- OCM integrated into project governance
- Portfolio view of change capacity
- Dedicated OCM function or center of excellence

**Typical Outcomes**:
- Measured and improving outcomes
- Proactive identification of at-risk changes
- Organizational change capacity managed
- OCM viewed as strategic capability

**Indicators**:
- "We measure OCM effectiveness on every change"
- "Our change portfolio is managed for saturation risk"
- "Our OCM practices improve based on what we learn"

### Level 5: Optimized

At the Optimized level, OCM capability is a strategic differentiator. The organization has a change-ready culture that embraces continuous evolution. OCM is embedded in organizational DNA.

**Characteristics**:
- OCM expertise drives competitive advantage
- Change-ready culture throughout organization
- Continuous improvement is continuous
- Innovation in OCM practices
- OCM embedded in all strategic initiatives

**Typical Outcomes**:
- Change is a core organizational competency
- Faster time-to-value on all initiatives
- Resilient, adaptable workforce
- Industry-leading change outcomes

**Indicators**:
- "Our ability to change faster than competitors is a strategic advantage"
- "Change readiness is part of our culture"
- "We're known for our excellence in managing change"

## Assessing Your Maturity Level

### Assessment Dimensions

Evaluate maturity across multiple dimensions:

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Methodology** | Is there a defined OCM approach? How consistently is it applied? |
| **Resources** | Are dedicated OCM resources available? What is their expertise? |
| **Tools** | Are OCM tools and templates available? How effective are they? |
| **Governance** | Is OCM integrated into project governance? Are OCM requirements enforced? |
| **Measurement** | Is OCM effectiveness measured? Are metrics used for improvement? |
| **Sponsorship** | Do leaders understand and support OCM? Is sponsorship consistently strong? |
| **Culture** | Is change embraced? How change-ready is the organization? |

### Self-Assessment Questions

For each dimension, rate your organization (1-5):

**Methodology**
1. No methodology exists
2. Informal approaches used inconsistently
3. Standard methodology defined and applied
4. Methodology continuously improved based on data
5. Best-in-class methodology, industry recognition

**Resources**
1. No dedicated OCM resources
2. Part-time or borrowed resources
3. Defined OCM roles, some dedicated resources
4. Staffed OCM function, professional development
5. Strategic OCM capability, industry-leading expertise

**Tools**
1. No OCM tools or templates
2. Basic templates used inconsistently
3. Comprehensive toolkit, consistent use
4. Tools integrated with project management systems
5. Advanced tools, analytics, continuous innovation

**Governance**
1. No OCM governance requirements
2. OCM encouraged but not required
3. OCM required for qualifying projects
4. OCM integrated into project lifecycle governance
5. OCM embedded in all change activities, strategic planning

**Measurement**
1. No OCM measurement
2. Activity tracking only
3. Outcome metrics defined and tracked
4. Data-driven improvement, benchmarking
5. Predictive analytics, leading indicators

**Sponsorship**
