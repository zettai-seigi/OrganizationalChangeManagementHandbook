## What is Change Readiness Assessment?

Change Readiness Assessment evaluates an organization's capacity and willingness to adopt a specific change. It identifies strengths to leverage, gaps to address, and risks to mitigate before and during implementation.

### Assessment Dimensions

| Dimension | Focus Areas |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Organizational** | Culture, structure, capacity, resources |
| **Leadership** | Sponsorship, commitment, coalition |
| **Manager** | Skills, willingness, capacity |
| **Individual** | Awareness, desire, knowledge, ability |
| **Historical** | Past change success, lessons learned |

## Organizational Readiness Factors

### Culture Assessment

| Factor | Assessment Questions |
|--------|---------------------|
| Change orientation | Is change viewed positively? |
| Risk tolerance | How are mistakes handled? |
| Collaboration | Do silos exist? |
| Innovation | Are new ideas welcomed? |
| Trust | Do employees trust leadership? |

### Capacity Assessment

- Current workload and priorities
- Concurrent change initiatives
- Available resources (time, budget, people)
- Support infrastructure

### Change Saturation Analysis

**Change Saturation** occurs when too many changes compete for limited organizational capacity.

| Saturation Level | Indicators | Action |
|-----------------|------------|--------|
| **Low** | Few concurrent changes, high engagement | Proceed |
| **Medium** | Multiple changes, some fatigue | Prioritize, sequence |
| **High** | Change overload, resistance increasing | Defer or consolidate |
