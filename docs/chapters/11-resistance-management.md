- Past experiences that shape current reactions

### Root Causes (ADKAR-based)

| ADKAR Gap | Resistance Manifestation | Intervention |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------|
| Awareness | "Why change?" | Communication |
| Desire | "What's in it for me?" | Sponsorship, engagement |
| Knowledge | "I don't know how" | Training |
| Ability | "I can't do it" | Coaching, support |
| Reinforcement | "This won't last" | Recognition, accountability |
