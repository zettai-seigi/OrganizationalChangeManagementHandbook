## Best Practices

### 1. Start Early
Begin OCM planning at project inception, not after technical design is complete.

### 2. Engage Sponsors Actively
Ensure sponsors are visible, active, and consistent throughout the change.

People need to hear messages 5-7 times through multiple channels.

### 4. Make It Personal

Create feedback mechanisms and adjust plans based on input.

### 6. Build Capability

Design reinforcement mechanisms from the start.
