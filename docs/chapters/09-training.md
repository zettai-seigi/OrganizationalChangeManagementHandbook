## The Role of Training in OCM

Training is the primary mechanism for building the knowledge and skills stakeholders need to successfully adopt change. In the ADKAR model, training directly addresses the Knowledge element and creates the foundation for Ability. Without effective training, even motivated employees cannot successfully adopt new ways of working.

However, training alone is not sufficient for change adoption. A common mistake is treating training as the entirety of OCM, assuming that if people are trained, they will adopt. Training builds knowledge, but other OCM activities must build awareness, desire, ability (through practice and support), and reinforcement. Training is necessary but not sufficient.

Effective training in a change context differs from routine skills training in several important ways:

**Context Matters**: Training must connect to why the change is happening and how it benefits learners, not just what to do differently.

**Timing is Critical**: Training delivered too early is forgotten; training delivered too late creates anxiety and errors.

**Application Support**: Training must be followed by opportunities to practice and receive support during initial application.

**Emotional Dimension**: Learners may be anxious about their ability to succeed. Training must build confidence, not just competence.

## Training Strategy Development

### Aligning with Impact Assessment

Training strategy begins with impact assessment findings. For each stakeholder group, understand:

- What skills are required in the future state?
- What skills do they currently have?
- What is the gap that training must close?
- How complex is the learning required?
- How much time is available for training?

### Defining Learning Objectives

For each training audience, define clear learning objectives that specify what learners will be able to do after training:

**Well-Written Learning Objectives:**
- "Process a customer order using the new system within 5 minutes"
- "Generate and interpret the weekly sales dashboard"
- "Escalate system issues through the correct support channel"

**Poorly-Written Learning Objectives:**
- "Understand the new system" (not measurable)
- "Be familiar with the changes" (not specific)
- "Know how to use reports" (not behavioral)

### Role-Based Training Design

Different roles require different training. Design role-based curricula that address specific job needs:

| Role | Learning Needs | Training Approach |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| End Users | Core transactions, common scenarios | Hands-on practice, job aids |
| Power Users | Advanced functions, troubleshooting | Extended training, certification |
| Managers | Reporting, team support, exception handling | Focused sessions, coaching prep |
| Support Staff | System administration, issue resolution | Technical deep-dive, lab exercises |
| Executives | Dashboard review, strategic insights | Brief overview, key metrics focus |

---

## Adult Learning Principles

Effective training applies adult learning principles (andragogy) that recognize how adults learn differently from children:

### Key Principles

**Self-Direction**: Adults want control over their learning. Provide choices and self-paced options where possible.

**Experience**: Adults bring relevant experience. Build on what they already know; connect new learning to existing knowledge.

**Relevance**: Adults need to see why learning matters. Explain the "why" and connect to their job responsibilities.

**Problem-Centered**: Adults prefer learning that solves real problems. Use realistic scenarios and practical applications.

**Immediate Application**: Adults want to apply learning quickly. Train close to when skills will be used.

**Respect**: Adults expect their time and intelligence to be respected. Avoid condescension; acknowledge their expertise.

### Application to Training Design

| Principle | Training Design Implication |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Self-Direction | Offer e-learning for self-paced modules; provide choice in workshop timing |
| Experience | Include activities that draw on current job knowledge; acknowledge what won't change |
| Relevance | Start each module by explaining job relevance; use role-specific examples |
| Problem-Centered | Use realistic scenarios based on actual job tasks; include troubleshooting |
| Immediate Application | Schedule training close to go-live; provide job aids for immediate reference |
| Respect | Keep training focused and efficient; acknowledge competing priorities |

## Training Content Development

### Content Structure

Effective training content follows a logical structure:

**Introduction**
- Learning objectives (what they'll be able to do)
- Relevance (why this matters for their job)
- Overview (what will be covered)

**Core Content**
- Concepts and principles (the "why")
- Procedures and steps (the "how")
- Demonstrations (showing how it's done)
- Practice activities (doing it themselves)

**Application**
- Realistic scenarios
- Common challenges and solutions
- Tips and best practices
- Resources for ongoing support

**Conclusion**
- Summary of key points
- Job aids and reference materials
- Next steps and support channels

### Content Types

| Content Type | Purpose | Best For |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| Conceptual | Explain why and how things work | Building understanding, decision-making |
| Procedural | Step-by-step instructions | Transaction processing, routine tasks |
| Reference | Quick lookup of information | Job aids, help systems, FAQs |
| Scenario-Based | Practice in realistic situations | Complex tasks, judgment calls |

### Job Aids

Job aids are reference materials that support performance without requiring memorization. Effective job aids:

- Focus on steps and decisions, not concepts
- Use visual formats (flowcharts, screenshots, checklists)
- Are easily accessible at the point of work
- Are kept up-to-date as processes change

**Types of Job Aids:**
- Quick reference cards
- Process flowcharts
- Decision trees
- Checklists
- FAQs
- Video tutorials

## Training Delivery Methods

### Delivery Options

| Method | Strengths | Limitations | Best For |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Instructor-Led Classroom | Interaction, practice, immediate feedback | Scheduling, travel, cost | Complex skills, hands-on practice |
| Virtual Instructor-Led | Reaches distributed audiences, interactive | Technology issues, engagement | Remote teams, moderate complexity |
| E-Learning (Self-Paced) | Flexibility, consistency, scalability | Limited interaction, completion rates | Basic concepts, compliance, refresh |
| Blended | Combines benefits of multiple methods | More complex to design | Most change situations |
| On-the-Job | Real context, immediate application | Quality varies, capacity constraints | Practice, reinforcement |
| Coaching/Mentoring | Personalized, addresses individual needs | Resource-intensive | High-complexity, leadership roles |

### Blended Learning Design

Most change initiatives benefit from blended learning that combines methods:

**Pre-Work (E-Learning)**
- Basic concepts and terminology
- System overview and navigation
- Completed before classroom sessions

**Classroom/Virtual Sessions**
- Hands-on practice with guided instruction
- Realistic scenarios and exercises
- Q&A and discussion

**Post-Training (On-the-Job)**
- Application with support
- Job aids and quick reference
- Access to help resources

### Hands-On Practice

Effective skill-building requires practice, not just information transfer. Design practice activities that:

- Mirror actual job tasks
- Progress from simple to complex
- Provide immediate feedback
- Allow mistakes in a safe environment
- Build confidence through success

## Training Logistics

### Scheduling Considerations

Training scheduling requires balancing multiple constraints:

**Business Operations**: Minimize disruption to operations; consider peak periods and coverage needs

**Learning Retention**: Train close to go-live (within 2-4 weeks) for best retention

**Sequencing**: Train dependent skills in order; train trainers/support before end users

**Capacity**: Align with classroom/system capacity and trainer availability

### Training Environment

For system training, the training environment matters:

**Training System**: Separate environment with realistic data that mirrors production

**Workstations**: Adequate equipment matching actual work setup

**Facilities**: Appropriate room size, layout, and technology

**Materials**: All materials prepared and tested in advance

### Communication About Training

Stakeholders need to know:
- What training is available/required
- When and where training occurs
- How to register or access
- What to do to prepare
- What support is available after training

---

## Evaluating Training Effectiveness

### Kirkpatrick's Four Levels

The Kirkpatrick model provides a framework for evaluating training at four levels:

**Level 1: Reaction**
- Did participants like the training?
- Measured by end-of-training surveys
- Useful for improving training design

**Level 2: Learning**
- Did participants acquire intended knowledge and skills?
- Measured by assessments, demonstrations, tests
- Verifies training achieved learning objectives

**Level 3: Behavior**
- Are participants applying what they learned on the job?
- Measured by observation, performance data, manager feedback
- Verifies transfer from training to workplace

**Level 4: Results**
- Did training contribute to business outcomes?
- Measured by business metrics, ROI analysis
- Verifies training delivered intended value

### Measurement Methods

| Level | Measurement Methods | Timing |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| Reaction | Satisfaction surveys, feedback forms | Immediately after training |
| Learning | Knowledge checks, skill demonstrations, assessments | End of training, shortly after |
| Behavior | Observation, performance metrics, manager assessment | 30-90 days after training |
| Results | Business KPIs, adoption metrics, ROI | 3-6 months after implementation |

### Using Evaluation Data

Evaluation data should drive action:

- **Low reaction scores**: Improve training design, materials, or delivery
- **Low learning scores**: Redesign content, add practice, adjust pacing
- **Low behavior transfer**: Add on-the-job support, coaching, reinforcement
- **Low business results**: Examine other barriers beyond training

## Training Challenges and Solutions

### Common Challenges

**Insufficient Time**: Stakeholders feel they don't have time for training
- Solution: Make training efficient and clearly relevant; executive communication about priority

**Training Too Early**: Skills forgotten before go-live
- Solution: Train close to go-live; provide refresh options and job aids

**No Opportunity to Practice**: Training without application
- Solution: Include hands-on practice; sandbox environments; coached application

**One-Size-Fits-All**: Training doesn't match audience needs
- Solution: Role-based design; pre-assessment to place learners appropriately

**Completion Without Competence**: Attendance doesn't equal proficiency
- Solution: Proficiency assessments; certification requirements; follow-up support

### Supporting Struggling Learners

Some learners will struggle with new skills. Support options include:

- Additional practice sessions
- One-on-one coaching or mentoring
- Peer support and buddy systems
- Extended access to training environments
- Modified job assignments during transition
- Patience and encouragement

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Training builds the Knowledge and Ability** elements of ADKAR but must be integrated with other OCM activities
- **Adult learning principles** guide effective training design for organizational change
- **Role-based training** addresses specific job needs rather than generic content
- **Blended learning approaches** combine methods for optimal effectiveness
- **Timing matters**: train close to go-live for retention, but early enough for confidence
- **Evaluation at multiple levels** ensures training achieves intended outcomes
- **Support after training** is essential for successful skill transfer

---

## Summary

Training and capability building is a critical OCM execution activity that equips stakeholders with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in the future state. Effective training is grounded in impact assessment findings, applies adult learning principles, uses appropriate delivery methods, and evaluates outcomes at multiple levels.

Training must be integrated with other OCM activities. Communication builds awareness and desire that motivate learning. Sponsorship signals organizational priority. Post-training support enables successful application. Reinforcement sustains new skills over time. Without this integration, even excellent training will fail to produce sustained adoption.

The investment in well-designed, well-delivered training pays dividends through faster time to proficiency, fewer errors during transition, higher confidence and morale, and ultimately higher sustained adoption rates.
