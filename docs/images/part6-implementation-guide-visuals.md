- Do you have strong executive sponsorship NOW?
- Is there urgent business need?
- Are resources available immediately?
- Can you accept high initial risk?
- Is your organization change-ready?

**Choose Phased if you answer YES to most**:
- Do you have moderate support that can grow?
- Is 18-24 month timeline acceptable?
- Do you want to balance speed and risk?
- Can you build capability incrementally?
- Do you want learning between phases?

**Choose Pilot if you answer YES to most**:
- Must you prove value before commitment?
