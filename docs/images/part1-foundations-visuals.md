### Visual 03-Figure-3.6: CSF Interdependencies Map

**Type**: Network Diagram / Relationship Map

**Title**: How the 8 Critical Success Factors Work Together

**Chapter Reference**: Chapter 3, "CSF Interdependencies" section

**Purpose**: Show the relationships and dependencies between all 8 CSFs to help readers understand the systemic nature of OCM.

**Content Description**:
- Eight CSF nodes arranged in a circular pattern
- CSF 1 (Sponsorship) at the top, emphasized as foundational
- Relationship arrows showing key dependencies
- Arrow labels explaining the relationship
- Color coding by CSF category (matching framework visual)
- Central element showing "Integrated OCM System"
- Visual hierarchy showing primary vs secondary relationships

**Visual Flow**:
1. CSF nodes arranged in circular pattern
2. CSF 1 at 12 o'clock position, visually prominent
3. Relationship arrows connecting interdependent CSFs
4. Arrow thickness showing strength of relationship
5. Central integration element
6. Legend explaining arrow types

**Key Elements**:
- Eight CSF circles (150px diameter)
- CSF number and name in each circle
- Color coding matching framework categories
- Directional arrows with labels (3px solid, 2px dashed)
- Arrow labels in 11pt explaining relationship
- Central integration circle (180px diameter)
- Visual emphasis on CSF 1 (200px diameter, glow effect)
- Relationship types: Enables, Feeds into, Supports, Provides feedback

**Specifications**:
- Dimensions: 1800px × 1800px (square)
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Fonts: Source Sans Pro for all text
- CSF circles: 150px diameter (200px for CSF 1)
- Circular arrangement radius: 600px from center
- Arrow weights: 3px for primary relationships, 2px for secondary
- Arrow colors: Match source CSF color
- Label backgrounds: White with 70% opacity
- Center circle: Primary Blue with subtle glow

**Caption**: Figure 3.6: The 8 Critical Success Factors form an integrated system where each supports and reinforces the others. Sponsorship (CSF 1) enables all other factors. Measurement (CSF 8) provides feedback to all factors for continuous improvement. Weakness in any factor affects the entire system.

**Position in Chapter**: After the "CSF Interdependencies" ASCII diagram, before "Key Takeaways"

**Notes**: Show the specific interdependencies described in the chapter ASCII diagram. Use arrows to show directional influence. Make CSF 1 visually prominent to emphasize its foundational role.

### Visual 03-Figure-3.7: Kirkpatrick Training Evaluation Model

**Type**: Stacked Level Diagram

**Title**: Evaluating Training Effectiveness: The Four Kirkpatrick Levels

**Chapter Reference**: Chapter 3, "CSF 5: Training and Capability Building" section

**Purpose**: Illustrate the four levels of training evaluation showing progression from reaction to business results.

**Content Description**:
- Four horizontal levels stacked vertically
- Bottom to top: Level 1 (Reaction) → Level 2 (Learning) → Level 3 (Behavior) → Level 4 (Results)
- Each level shows: name, what it measures, methods, and timing
- Color progression from lightest (bottom) to darkest (top)
- Icons representing each level
- Difficulty/value arrow on left showing increasing value
- Timeline indicator on right showing when to measure

**Visual Flow**:
1. Bottom: Level 1 - Reaction (immediate, easiest)
2. Level 2 - Learning
3. Level 3 - Behavior
4. Top: Level 4 - Results (longest term, most valuable)
5. Left side: Value arrow pointing up
6. Right side: Timeline showing measurement points

**Key Elements**:
- Four level bars spanning width
- Level numbers in circles on left
- Level names in 20pt bold
- "Measures" section in 14pt
- Methods listed with icons
- Timing indicators on right
- Color gradient: Light Gray → Medium Gray → Primary Blue → Success Green
- Value arrow showing progression
- Icons: Smiley face (Reaction), Brain (Learning), Walking person (Behavior), Trophy (Results)

**Specifications**:
- Dimensions: 1600px × 1200px (landscape)
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Fonts: Source Sans Pro (headers), Open Sans (body)
- Level bar height: 240px
- Spacing between levels: 20px
- Icon size: 64px × 64px
- Value arrow: 120px wide on left side
- Timeline: 120px wide on right side
- Number circles: 80px diameter

**Caption**: Figure 3.7: The Kirkpatrick Four-Level Model evaluates training effectiveness from immediate reaction through learning, behavior change, and ultimately business results. Higher levels require longer timeframes to measure but provide greater insight into training impact.

**Position in Chapter**: Within CSF 5 section, after the "Training Effectiveness Levels" table

**Notes**: Show the progression of both difficulty and value. Include timing information (immediate, days, weeks, months) on the right side.
