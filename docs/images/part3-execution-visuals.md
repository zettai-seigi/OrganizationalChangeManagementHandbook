**Caption**: Figure 11.5: The Resistance Management Dashboard tracks key metrics (current resistance level with target <10%, average resolution time with target <2 weeks, trend direction, escalation rate) and provides detailed issue tracking. The resistance log shows individual resistance cases with root causes, interventions, owners, and status. Trend analysis reveals patterns and informs prevention strategies.

**Position in Chapter**: Within "Tracking and Reporting" section, expanding on the resistance log table

**Notes**: Include the three specific resistance examples from the chapter (Operations manager capacity concerns, Finance team slow adoption, IT passive resistance). Show realistic data with varied statuses and priorities. Include trend chart showing resistance declining over 12-week period from 25% to 8%. Add pie chart showing root cause distribution (Desire 40%, Ability 30%, Knowledge 20%, Awareness 10%).

## Summary of Part 3 Visuals

**Total Visuals**: 19 comprehensive diagrams and dashboards

**Distribution by Chapter**:
- Chapter 8 (Communication): 6 visuals
- Chapter 9 (Training): 5 visuals
- Chapter 10 (Sponsorship): 4 visuals
- Chapter 11 (Resistance Management): 5 visuals (including a fishbone diagram added)

**Primary Visual Types**:
- Framework diagrams: 4
- Process flows and journeys: 4
- Matrices and comparison visuals: 4
- Dashboards and trackers: 4
- Decision trees and diagnostic tools: 3

**Key Themes**:
- Communication planning and execution (5 Rights framework)

- Sponsorship effectiveness (Roles, activities, measurement)
- Resistance diagnosis and management (ADKAR-based, escalation)

All visuals maintain the consistent color palette, typography, and design language established in Parts 1 and 2, ensuring cohesive visual identity throughout the entire handbook. Each visual is designed to be both informative and practical, serving as tools readers can reference and apply in their OCM work.

## Cross-Part Visual Consistency

**Recurring Visual Patterns**:
- ADKAR model elements consistently colored across all parts
- Stakeholder representations using same icons/colors
- Dashboards following same layout and metric card style
- Process flows using consistent arrow styles and box formats
- Matrix diagrams maintaining same cell structure and color logic

**Design System Elements**:
- Primary heading font: Source Sans Pro (headers 16-24pt bold)
- Body text font: Open Sans (body 11-14pt regular, italic for examples)
- Consistent icon style: Line icons, 2px stroke, 48-80px sizes
- Rounded corners: 8-10px standard across cards and boxes
- Drop shadows: Subtle consistent depth (2px blur, 20% opacity)
- Border weights: 2-4px depending on hierarchy
- Grid spacing: 50px standard gap between elements

This comprehensive visual specification system ensures that all graphics created for the OCM Handbook will have a professional, cohesive appearance that enhances learning and reference use.
