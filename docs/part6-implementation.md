# Part VI: Implementation Guide

This section provides practical guidance for implementing OCM capability in your organization, including roadmaps, best practices, lessons learned, and guidance for continuous improvement.

## Overview

Knowing OCM theory is not the same as implementing it effectively. This section bridges theory and practice:

- **Chapter 17: Implementation Roadmap** - A phased approach to establishing OCM capability
- **Chapter 18: Best Practices and Common Pitfalls** - Lessons learned from successful and failed OCM initiatives
- **Chapter 19: Moving Forward with Continuous Improvement** - Sustaining and advancing OCM practice

## Starting Your OCM Journey

Whether you're:

- **Starting from scratch** with no formal OCM practice
- **Improving existing** ad-hoc OCM activities
- **Optimizing mature** OCM capabilities

This section provides relevant guidance for your situation.

## Implementation Approaches

Organizations typically follow one of three approaches:

| Approach | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Big Bang** | Implement full OCM framework at once | Large organizations with resources |
| **Phased** | Roll out OCM capabilities incrementally | Most organizations |
| **Pilot** | Prove OCM value on select projects first | Organizations needing to build support |

## Success Factors for Implementation

Chapter 17's roadmap emphasizes:

1. **Executive sponsorship** for OCM capability building
2. **Quick wins** to demonstrate value early
3. **Skill development** for OCM practitioners
4. **Tool and template** standardization
5. **Metrics** that prove OCM contribution to project success

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

Chapter 18 catalogs the most common mistakes organizations make when implementing OCM, including:

- Treating OCM as optional or "nice to have"
- Starting OCM too late in project lifecycle
- Under-resourcing OCM activities
- Failing to engage sponsors effectively
- Measuring activity instead of outcomes
