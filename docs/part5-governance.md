# Part V: Governance and Controls

This section establishes the governance structures, policies, and standards that ensure OCM is practiced consistently and effectively across the organization.

## Overview

Without governance, OCM becomes ad-hoc and inconsistent, with quality varying by project and practitioner. This section provides:

- **Chapter 15: Governance Framework** - Establishing OCM governance structures, roles, and decision rights
- **Chapter 16: Policies, Standards, and Compliance** - Defining organizational policies and standards for OCM practice

## Why Governance Matters

Effective OCM governance ensures:

- **Consistency** - All change initiatives follow standard OCM practices
- **Quality** - OCM deliverables meet defined standards
- **Accountability** - Clear ownership and responsibility for OCM outcomes
- **Compliance** - OCM activities align with regulatory and organizational requirements
- **Continuous Improvement** - Lessons learned feed back into practice improvement

## Governance Components

The governance framework established in this section includes:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Roles and Responsibilities** | Who does what in OCM |
| **Decision Rights** | Who approves OCM plans and changes |
| **Standards** | What "good" OCM looks like |
| **Policies** | Mandatory requirements for OCM |
| **Metrics** | How OCM effectiveness is measured |
| **Review Processes** | How OCM quality is assured |

## Integration with IT Governance

OCM governance should integrate with existing IT governance structures including:

- Project and portfolio management
- IT service management
- Enterprise architecture
- Risk management
- Compliance and audit
